This directory stores all the source .h files needed to build the
executable programs and also support the development of
libraries written in C++. Test and Applications also used
this library.

Files:
        - README: (is this file) contains general information of the 
                                cellular-automata library include subdirectory 

        - There is no makefile for this directory. These files 
                are source .h (include) files

        - cellular_automata.h: This file contains C++ class definition of the basic
                data structures for the cellular automata library

        - error_code.h: This file contains the definition of error codes
                for the cellular automata library.

        - library.h: This file contains the API for the cellular automata library.
