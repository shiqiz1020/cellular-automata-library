This directory contains tests and examples on how to use
the functionality developed in the ../Src directory.

Files and Subdirectories:
  - README: (this file) has a general description of the test programs.

  - Makefile: # This makefile creates objects from basic tests for the 
    cellular automata library. After creation the objects are relocated 
    to the ../Bindir directory
 
  - ca_evolve_sanity_test.cpp: this file contains the c++ implementation 
    as a sanity check of the cellular automata operations for the cellular 
    automata library.

  - cancer_cell_model.cpp: This file contains the c++ implementation for the
    cancer cell metastatis model of the cellular automata operations for the 
    cellular automata library.
