Main software develoment directory where all the source C++ and C
files are stored and commpiled. Tests and examples on how to use
the functionality developed here are in the ../Tests subdirectory.

Files and Subdirectories:
  - README: (this file) has a general description of source
            development subdirectory.

  - Intentionally there is no makefile at this level to force
    builds only by functionality (e.g., Compute)
 
  - Compute: cellular automata compute operations for the cellular 
        automata library

  - Input: Contains definition of data structures and c++ implementation 
        of the cellular automata data structure for the cellular 
        automata library
