This subdirectory contains definition of data structures and c++ implementation 
        of the cellular automata data structure for the cellular 
        automata library

Files:
  - README: (this file) has a general description of input subdirectory.

  - Makefile: The Makefile in this directory can execute command line statements 
  to run the cellular_automata.cpp, input.cpp and cleanup of the programs.

  - cellular_automata.cpp: the c++ implementation of the cellular automata data structure.

  - input.cpp: the c++ implementation of the input setup phase for the cellular automata library
