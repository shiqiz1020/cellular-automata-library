This directory contains only object code files and libraries. 
There is no Makefile in this directory because nothing is built 
here.

C++ Programs under the ../Src subdirectory 
create object files and libraries that should be stored in 
this subdirectory.  

Files:
        - README: (is this file) contains general information of the 
			  cellular-automata library Libdir subdirectory 

	- There is no makefile for this directory. These files 
	  are object .o files

        - ca_operators.o: object file generated from /Src/Compute/ca_operator.cpp

        - cellular_automata.o: object file generated from /Src/Input/cellular_automata.cpp

        - input.o: object file generated from /Src/Input/input.cpp
